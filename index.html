    <h4>History Of Atlanta</h4>
    <p>
        The name “Nairobi” comes from the Maasai phrase 'Enkare Nyrobi', which translates to “cool water”. 
        The area Nairobi currently occupies was essentially uninhabited swamp until a supply depot of the 
        Uganda Railway was built by the British in 1899 linking Mombasa to Uganda.

    <h5>Importance Of Altanta</h5>
    <p>
        Nairobi also plays an important role in the community of eastern African states; 
        it is the headquarters of important regional railways, harbours, and airways corporations.
        The city is well served by roads and railways.
